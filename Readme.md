# BlinKeyInfo

WIP project not fit for human consumption. Meant to work with my BlinKey/OneKey keyboard which emulates the blink(1) USB controlled RGB LED.

I use this project to set the colour of my one key keyboard prototype, updates based on time and CPU usage. Run every minute with launchd. Not guaranteed to work for anyone else yet.
